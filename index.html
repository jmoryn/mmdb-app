                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>Referred to as "the Walt Disney of Japan," Hayao Miyazaki's films have inspired and delighted people around the world for more than 40 years. With loveable characters, rich storylines, relatable themes, and gorgeous animation, it's no surprise his films continue to be relevant long after their release. Miyazaki is also cofounder of the famous animation company "Studio Ghibli," created in 1985 along with his friends Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki, and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. <br/><br/> Of course, any discussion of Miyazaki wouldn't be complete without mentioning  Joe Hisaishi. He has scored all of Miyazaki's films with the exception of Lupin the third. Just as Steven Spielberg needs John Williams and Christopher Nolan needs Hans Zimmer, so too does Hayao Miyazaki need Joe Hisaishi for his films to be complete. <br/><br/> Now at the age of 80, Miyazaki continues to make films. He has tried to retire at least 3 times, but his son Goro has stated that Miyazaki loves his art so much, he needs to create more "in order to live." We are all fortunate that he maintains such a passion for his craft.</p>
